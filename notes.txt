Protection:
(history, command) -> events

Interpretation:
events -> state

Intention:
state -> command

Automation:
events -> command

state is:
[event]
[command]
[query] <so what about query? how should i use it?>

about IO:
IO -> event
event -> IO <is i should do it by command handling or any else way?>

about handling:
[event] -> command : event_handler
query -> ? : query_handler
command -> [event] : command_handler <is those events have an (f: event -> command)? is it isomorphic?>
if yes, then i have ([event] -> [handled_event]) also
